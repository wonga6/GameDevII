It seems as though more mortals have stumbled upon this tomb once again. You must be here for the Rosetta Stone that dwells in its depths. I, Dolos, am the keeper of the Stone.
While you're here, perhaps you can provide me with some...entertainment. The stage is set. There's no escape, you must go forward. I won't stop you, but I can't promise something else won't.
Ah, you've finally found your new companion. I was wondering when you'd stumble upon each other. I can't wait to see how this will go over for the two of you.
I'm sure you realize you're not the only ones in this maze. Careful around the Minotaur. It's not what you'd call...friendly.
You've done well. I'm impressed. But consider this the final act of your performance. Before you stands the Rosetta Stone you seek and a copy that I've created. The craftsmanship is impeccable, if I do say so myself.
