Beni
Stick together?
Maia
For now, yeah.

Maia
Who puts a maze in a tomb?
Beni
Someone who likes to torture people.

Beni
What was that?
Maia
Some big hulking beast.

Beni
Should stay clear of it.
Maia
Well, I don't intend to go say "hello"...
break

Maia
I'm not seeing a way through this.
Beni
Really? It's right here.
break

Maia
Guess we'll have to put what we see together.
Beni
It seem so. Can't anything be simple?
break

Maia
Think we'll ever get out of here?
Beni
Fingers crossed....
break

Maia
Thank God.
Beni
Not yet. Who knows if there's more waiting for us?
break

Maia
Which one should I pick?
Beni
Honestly, I don't know.
