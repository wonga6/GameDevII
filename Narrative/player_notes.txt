n_united:
   * I don’t see us getting out of here anytime soon.
   * That we can agree on.
   * Stick together?
   * For now, yeah. 

n_maze_0:
   * Who puts a maze in a tomb?
   * Someone who likes to torture people.

n_minotaur_approach:
   * Did you hear that?
   * I didn’t hear anything.

n_minotaur:
   * What was that?
   * Some big hulking beast.
   * Should stay clear of it.
   * Well, I don’t intend to go say “hello”..

n_minotaur_avoided:
   * Think we lost that thing?
   * I wouldn’t bank on it.

n_maze_1:
   * I’m not seeing a way through this.
   * Really? It’s right there.
   * I’m not crazy, I don’t see a way through.

n_maze_2:
   * Guess we’ll have to put what we see together.
   * It seems so. Can’t anything be simple?
   * That’d be asking too much.

n_maze_3:
   * Think we’ll ever get out of here?
   * Fingers crossed…

n_maze_end:
   * Thank God.
   * Not yet. Who knows if there’s more waiting for us.

1. n_choose:
   * Which one should we pick?
   * Honestly, I don’t know.
